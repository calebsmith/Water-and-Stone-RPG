These are sad times
lad. I wish I knew
what I could do to
help you. Go talk to
the village elder. He
lives at the west end
of the village. I'm
sure he'll have some
information for you.
Good luck boy!

Please Help me! I'm a
citizen of Riendale
and I cannot enter the
town for fear of the
rabbid animal that is
lurking around in
there. Please take my
sword and slay the
beast so that things
can return to normal.

Thank you so much kind
stranger. Your good
deed shall be

A rabbid beast you say?
Do be careful lad. Be
sure you have a healing
potion from the magic
shop and a decent
weapon.

Please! Help the people
of Riendale by killing
the beast that plagues
their town.

You have done a great
service to the people
of Riendale. If you
continue to do such
things then I'm sure
your efforts will be
remembered.

If you've nothing else
to do you could always
go hunting and
exploring in the woods
north of here. Though I
do warn you to be
careful. Take a
skinning knife to help
you. They're sold in
the other town.

Ropes really can get
you out of a bad
situation sometimes.

The town elder always
seems to have something
he'd like done around
here.

Thank you so much kind
stranger for ridding
the town of that
rabbid animal. Take
my sword and gold as
tribute for your good
deed.

Who killed my father?

Who are you?

That is an answer
which no one seems to
know. You alone must
seek it if you wish to
find peace. However
some fishermen
reported a suspicious
group of men traveling
from across the bridge
outside of town.
^

A group of suspicious men?
503
I'll go talk to them then.

I am Traogon. I am rather
old and must stay here and

of more assistance but you
can always come to me for
advice.

Who killed my father?

Yes. They came from the
east on horseback and
rode off before anyone
could stop them. Go to
the piers and talk to
the fishermen for
further information.
I'm afraid that's all I
know.

Be patient child.
Important answers aren't
always so easy to find.
These fishermen can be
found outside of town
along the beach to the
east of here. I bid the
farewell.

Farewell then.

Twas five of 'em came across da'
bridge see. Each had dark robes
and balaclavas. They bore
crimson insignias of two lizards
on their shields. I saw 'em on
dare way over an' didn't know
they was up to no good. They
rode away at an uncanny  speed
matey. Somethin' terribly
unnatural about it.
^

Uncanny speed you say?
604
Thanks. Good'ay.

Aye. You could barely see the
legs of the horses movin' as
the dark blur of their figures
shot back across the bridge.
Like magic I have never heard
of. An' mind you... I've heard
many a tale of sirens and
merefolk. People is afraid ta'
fix the bridge now... thinkin'
it be cursed.
^
2
Cursed? What?
605
I wouldn't fix it either.
606
*
605

People are afraid to go near
the bridge after all that and
it'd be hard to convince
anyone to fix it seein' as
its destruction makes people
feel safe. Me thinks nothins'
ta' stop 'em from sailin' over
if they wanted ta'.

Thanks for your time. Bye.

Aye me neither. They might
come back if'n we fix it but
seein' what I saw... I dunno
what could stop 'em really.

Greetings boy. Do you
remember me? I am Sif. I
am the widow of Balam. You
must be the son of Kahn. If
only they had taken me
instead. I don't know why
they spared me but they took
away my life when they
killed my dear husband.
^
2
Why were they after Balam?
651
What are you going to do?
652
*
651
&
6
They seemed to think he
either had some magical
stone or that he was in
cohorts with someone who did.
Balam never told me about it
though so I was confused the
whole time. Maybe they asked
your father about the same
thing. I would give any stone
to have my Balam back.
^
2
Thanks. Bye

What do you plan on doing?

I don't know what to do
now without Balam. What
are you doing child? Are
you seeking out revenge?
^
2
No. I Just need some answers.
653
Yes. In the name of Kahn.
654
*
653
&

Good because Kahn wouldn't
want any violent heroics
from his son. Can I do
anything to help?
^
2
Tell me everything you know.
655
No Thanks. Bye now.

*
654

Don't be ridiculous.
Kahn would never want you
to seek a bloody revenge.
If you truly cherish his
memory you would honor him
best by granting mercy.

Ok. Bye

I Don't really know much but
I believe the men were after
some sort of stone. I heard
they sacked a whole village
to the north. Evil Evil men
they must be.

I Don't know what demons

have been used to enchant
it.

Sometime in the middle
of the night last night
it started foaming at
the mouth AND attacking
me. I ran out of town to
get away. I hope she
didn't bite anybody.
