Water and Stone RPG
===================

A game engine in BASIC resurrected from my childhood.

Play for fun or read the source and cry.


Features
--------

    * Prolific examples of GOTO's and global variables
    * Direct memory fiddling for graphics and input
    * Liberal use of copy/paste coding techniques
    * Completely flat directory structure.


Installation
------------

Install `Dosbox <http://www.dosbox.com>`_ on your system according to the directions on their site. On debian flavored GNU/Linux you can try::

    apt-get install dosbox

Set the clock speed by typing `cycles=45000` at the DOS prompt or configuring your dosbox conf file.

Download the following DOS utilities::

    * Microsoft Basic Compiler Version 7.10
    * Microsoft Segmented-Executable Linker Version 5.10

These are BC.EXE and LINK.EXE respectively. Copy these programs into the same directory as this source code.

Run `build.bat` in a DOS prompt and press enter through all of the prompts

Running
-------

After compiling, run `start.exe` from a DOS prompt.

Enjoy
